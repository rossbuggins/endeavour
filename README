### Get Status

/object/endeavour/[endevourId]

202 Accepted
Location: endeavour url

201 Created

Location header: resource url

### Get Status Stream

/object/endeavour/[endevourId]/stream

Returns a stream of status data until endeavour is complete or timeout reached.


### Get Resource 

Use location header from endeavour status when 201 created is returned.

# Optional centralised endeavours

Endeavour launches are fully async.
Can await an endeavour until created is returned.

By default uses http stream.
